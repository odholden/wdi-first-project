# Blick.
## General Assembly WDI London - Project 1
### A simple and innovative game for all devices

Blick is an original game design that uses a randomly generated grid of colours to test and improve the players's memory. 

1. It accomodates two players, who compete against each other in three rounds.
2. There are three different difficulty levels, which can be dynamically selected between rounds.
3. It works best on a touchscreen device, but is designed repsonsively for most devices.
